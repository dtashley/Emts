This manual describes \emph{\productname{}}, a customizable tool integration
framework.

\emph{\productname{}} is a customizable tool integration framework:
\begin{itemize}
      \item It allows the same tools, built from the same source code,
            to be used in a consistent way in the following forms:
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item Standalone console-mode programs.
                  \item As built-in functions in a scripting language, \emph{CLIKE}.
                  \item As programs with a GUI interface.
            \end{itemize}
      \item It provides a base product with substantial functionality that can be
            customized and extended through:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The addition of functionality packaged as standalone conole-mode programs,
                      built-in functions in a scripting langauge, and panels in GUI
                      program.
                \item Customized opening graphics.

%Certum card instructions.
%
%Cut the card out of the holder.
%
%Installed in the reader (took a little guessing to get it open).
%
%Installed the SmartCard reader drivers from the ACS website.
%
%Rebooted to be sure.
%
%Installed the ProCertum CardManager, 64-bit MSI.
%
%Rebooted per instructions.
%
%Read card, Initialized, then set my standard 6-digit value for both PIN and PUK (they are set identically).
%
%20240810:  Results from renewing code signing certificate.  Went through automatic verification
%           process tonight.  It involved a cellphone and taking a picture of my identity
%           document (passport), and some shots of my face.
%
%           Status of process unclear.  Believe I've done all I can do.  Should know by
%           Monday, which should be a work day for Certum.
%
%           Process is unclear.  I believed I would use old certificate to help authenticate
%           the renewal, but from the instructions it appears that I don't do this.
%
%           Could not find earlier notes anywhere, so it appears I will have to re-document
%           how to use the card, or search more for my earlier notes.
