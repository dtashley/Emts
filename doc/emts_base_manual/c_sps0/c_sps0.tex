\section{Purchase and Setup of Code Signing Certificate}
%Section tag: PSC0
\label{csps0:spsc0}

Purchased from Certum.  All went according to published procedures,
except installation of certificate per instruction.

My issue is solved.  Please disregard my technical support request (although if there is
anything additional I should read, I'd be grateful for links).

a)I ran the command shell as administrator (that seems to make a difference).

b)I used the ``/debug'' option with SIGNTOOL and determined that it is only looking in
the Personal/Certificates area of the stored certificates.  The proCertum application
installs the certificate in the Other People/Certificates area of the stored
certificates, which is apparently not checked by SIGNTOOL. 
So I had to import the certificate into the right location.
