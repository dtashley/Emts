\chapter{Preface}

This manual describes \emph{\productname{}}, a tool integration
framework designed for embedded software development work.

\emph{\productname{}} provides the ability to package C/C++ tools
in several distinct forms, using the same underlying source code:

\begin{itemize}
      \item As commands available from an interactive shell, provided
            by the tool.
      \item As a console-mode program (no scripting or graphical functionality).
      \item As functions in a custom scripting language interpreter.
            (The scripting language is tentatively
            named \emph{\scriptinglanguagenamemc{}}).
      \item As functionality utilized from a \emph{Windows} GUI interface.
\end{itemize}

Although \emph{\productname{}} can be built for both \emph{Windows} and
\emph{Unix}, graphical capability is available only for \emph{Windows}.

\emph{\productname{}} is best described as a tool integration framework
because it is possible to integrate custom tools (most commonly,
proprietary corporate tools) into the framework and create proprietary or
custom tools that are a mixture of \emph{\productname{}} functionality
and proprietary or custom functionality.
