\chapter{Preface}

This manual describes \emph{\productname{}}, a tool integration
framework designed for embedded software development work.

\emph{\productname{}} provides the ability to package C/C++ tools
in several distinct forms, using the same source code:

\begin{itemize}
      \item As commands available from an interactive shell, provided
            by the tool.
      \item As functions in a scripting language, combined 
            with built-in \emph{\productname{}} functionality and
            possibly other tools.  (These functions can be used
            both from a script and interactively.)
      \item As functionality utilized from a \emph{Windows} GUI interface.
      \item As a console-mode program (no scripting or graphical functionality),
            containing a tool's functionality combined with the functionality of
            other tools.
      \item As a console-mode program (no scripting or graphical functionality)
            containing only an individual tool's
            functionality.
\end{itemize}

Although \emph{\productname{}} can be built for both \emph{Windows} and
\emph{Unix}, graphical capability is available only for \emph{Windows}.
